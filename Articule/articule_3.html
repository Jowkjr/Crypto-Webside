              MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin (BTC) advocate Michael Saylor
              doubled down on his support for Bitcoin as he explained the issues
              related to transferring the value of physical properties such as
              gold, company stocks or equity and real estate during the
              Australia Crypto Convention. Speaking about the underlying
              proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, Saylor highlighted that
              Bitcoin is backed by $20 billion worth of proprietary mining
              hardware and $20 billion worth of energy.Saylor further
              underscored the high maintenance costs and taxes linked with
              owning and inheriting physical property over the long term, which
              in the case of Bitcoin, does not exist.Geopolitical tensions
              across the world also determine the type of assets one would be
              allowed to carry forward across jurisdictions. He explained:
              “Bitcoin represents a property that you can acquire in small
              pieces that you can carry with you anywhere you go. You can give
              to your children’s children’s children’s children. And in 250
              years, maybe your family still owns the property.”According to
              Saylor, only royalties such as King Charles III have the liberty
              to pass down their wealth without worrying about being taxed away
              “unless it’s Bitcoin.” The entrepreneur reiterated that the
              Bitcoin network has not been hacked for over 13 years and is
              currently “the most secure network in the world.” On an end note,
              Saylor emphasized the regular upgrades being made on the Bitcoin
              network to make it faster and more secure, along with innovations
              around layer-2 and layer-3 applications. Bloomberg analyst Mike
              McGlone recently opined that Bitcoin is a “wild card” that is
              well-positioned to outperform stocks as traditional finance inches
              toward a recession. McGlone took it to social media platforms,
              including LinkedIn and Twitter, to state:“Bitcoin is a wild card
              that’s more ripe to outperform when stocks bottom, but
              transitioning to be more like gold and bonds.” As Cointelegraph
              reported, the analysis notes that while Bitcoin would follow a
              similar trend to treasury bonds and gold, Ether (ETH) “may have a
              higher correlation with stocks.”
