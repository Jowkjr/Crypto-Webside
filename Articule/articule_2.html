              Bukele says that despite past laws that prohibited the reelection
              of presidents, El Salvador can follow in the footsteps of
              developing nations. In an Independence Day live streaming event on
              Sept. 15, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele announced his bid for
              reelection after his current term ends in 2024. Bukele's
              announcement comes even though past presidents in El Salvador were
              prohibited by law from having consecutive terms in office. In an
              Independence Day live streaming event on Sept. 15, El Salvador
              President Nayib Bukele announced his bid for reelection after his
              current term ends in 2024. Bukele's announcement comes even though
              past presidents in El Salvador were prohibited by law from having
              consecutive terms in office.Overall, Bukele shows signs of solid
              support, as a CID Gallup poll conducted last month revealed an 85%
              approval rating of his presidency and 95% approval of his
              governance in security matters. However, in light of the
              announcement El Salvadorians took to the streets in protest.
              Thousands of protestors pushed back against Bukele’s corruption
              and the integration of Bitcoin, among other matters found
              disagreeable during his presidency. During his presidency, Bukele
              introduced Bitcoin as a legal tender in the country back in
              September 2021. The introduction of the largest cryptocurrency in
              the country recently hit its one-year anniversary, after a year of
              steady price declines. Despite introducing Bitcoin-centric
              educational programs such as “Mi Primera Bitcoin” — my first
              bitcoin — and being an example to neighboring countries like
              Columbia and Venezuela, the local population is not as keen on
              crypto as expected.A national survey from February of this year
              showed that 20% of the population actively used the Chivo Wallet,
              El Salvador’s preferred crypto wallet, for Bitcoin transitions.
              Otherwise, more than double the number downloaded for the initial
              free gift of $30. Only 20% of polled business owners said they
              accept crypto payments. Most of the businesses doing so were
              larger enterprises rather than small-scale shops. On the other
              hand, the adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender has introduced a
              new type of crypto-tourist to the country, despite the bear
              market. According to official numbers, local tourism was up by
              82.8% just this year. Critics continue to go back and forth on the
              topic of El Salvador’s usage and adoption of Bitcoin. Thousands
              may be protesting on the street against the policies surrounding
              digital currency. However, some still see it as technological and
              financial advancement for a developing country like El Salvador.
