              Uncertain BTC price action continues as Ethereum trends downward
              despite the successful Merge.Bitcoin (BTC) spent a second day
              threatening $20,000 support on Sept. 15 as markets processed the
              Ethereum ET Merge.Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and
              TradingView showed BTC/USD spiking below $20,000 again overnight
              to recover marginally above the boundary for a brief period. The
              largest cryptocurrency broadly failed to regain lost ground after
              surprise United States inflation data on Sep. 13 sent risk assets
              into a tailspin. Down 13.5% versus the week's top at the time of
              writing, Bitcoin offered little inspiration to traders who were
              still eyeing further losses.“Bullish above or after a reclaim of
              $20,800 or something like this and maybe up,” popular trader
              Crypto Ed summarized in his latest YouTube update. ellow trader Il
              Capo of Crypto again flagged $23,000 and $16,000 as important
              levels on either side of the spot price, calling them “like a
              magnet” in a tweet on the day. “Probably markets will remain calm
              until FED next week,” Michaël van de Poppe, founder and CEO of
              trading firm Eight, continued on the immediate macro outlook. The
              S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite Index were modestly up at the start
              of trading, like crypto still to recover from losses earlier in
              the week.ETH price plummets to three-week lows Altcoin markets
              meanwhile were led by the story-that-wasn't on Ethereum, which
              failed to react positively to the Merge.Despite the headlines,
              ETH/USD was down 8% on the day, circling $1,470 amid significant
              volatility.Reacting, trading firm Cumberland nonetheless argued
              that the Merge's smooth transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) was a
              “momemental” achievement in itself. “The fact that it was
              successful yet uneventful is an incredible testament to the people
              involved, what they've done for the world of crypto, digital
              assets, and decentralized computing,” part of a Twitter thread
              read. “Every Bitcoin Halving, people said the event was priced in.
              But every Halving was a buy-the-news event,” Charles Edwards,
              creator of analytics resource LookIntoBitcoin, added.
